# Simple-Banking-System

This program simulates the simplest online bank.
Allows:
- create a map (based on the Luna algorithm) and a password;
- log into your account using your card number and password;
- allows you to replenish the card;
- make transfers from card to another card (implemented verification of the recipient's card fidelity);<br/>
The sqlite3 database is used to store the data.
